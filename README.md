# üñ•Ô∏è Web Server Log Analysis Using Apache Spark

## üìä Project Overview
This project involves analyzing web server log data using Apache Spark to extract meaningful insights from a large dataset. By processing over 1 million log entries, this project identifies important traffic patterns, tracks errors, and monitors server performance.

## üìÅ Dataset
The dataset used is an Apache Web Server log file in the Common Log Format (CLF). It consists of over 1 million log entries from the NASA Kennedy Space Center server. Each log entry provides detailed information about web requests, including timestamps, IP addresses, HTTP methods, response codes, and content sizes.

## üöÄ Key Features
- **Log Parsing**: Corrected initial errors in parsing using refined regular expressions, successfully processing over 99.99% of log entries.
- **Error Analysis**: Analyzed 404 (Not Found) error patterns by day, hour, and specific URLs.
- **Traffic Monitoring**: Generated insights into traffic distribution across days, hours, and by specific endpoints.
- **Visualization**: Used Matplotlib to visualize trends, including hourly 404 errors, response codes, and traffic patterns.

## üìã Steps to Run the Project
1. **Set Up Environment**: Ensure Java 8 is installed for PySpark to function properly. Run the following command in your environment:
    ```bash
    !apt install openjdk-8-jdk-headless -qq
    ```
2. **Install PySpark**: Install the required PySpark package.
    ```bash
    !pip install pyspark
    ```
3. **Download the Dataset**: Download the NASA web server log dataset from [this link](http://ita.ee.lbl.gov/html/contrib/NASA-HTTP.html).
4. **Run the Analysis**: Load the dataset and run the provided Spark scripts to perform log parsing, error tracking, and traffic analysis.

## üìà Results
- **Log Parsing Success Rate**: 99.99% of logs were successfully parsed after regular expression refinement.
- **Top 404 Errors**: Identified the top 20 URLs responsible for 404 errors, revealing common broken links.
- **Traffic Insights**: Analyzed traffic patterns and identified peak activity hours and days.

 Developed a web server log analysis system using PySpark to process and analyze Apache server logs.
-	Corrected 108 parsing errors in the initial dataset by refining regular expressions, achieving a 99.99% log parsing success rate.
-	Conducted analysis of over 1 million log entries, producing insights such as top endpoints, response codes, and traffic patterns by day and hour.
-	Visualized key metrics like the top error-prone endpoints and 404 response code trends using Matplotlib, enhancing the ability to monitor server performance and detect issues.


## Visualization
Key metrics are visualized using Matplotlib, showcasing trends like:
- **Top 404 Error URLs**: Bar chart of URLs causing the most 404 errors.
- **Hourly 404 Error Distribution**: Line graph visualizing 404 errors over each hour of the day.
- **Daily Traffic Patterns**: Line graph showing the number of requests per day.

## üîÆ Future Work
- Extend the analysis to other server logs and integrate real-time monitoring.
- Implement machine learning models for predictive log analysis to identify potential issues in advance.
- Incorporate a user interface to provide real-time visual feedback.
